-What is this?

A very simple FAQ to help you know the project more.

-What is Pokemon Patched Crystal?

Pokemon Patched Crystal is a romhack of Pokemon Crystal which doesnt drastically alter the game's
content and gameplay but instead it improves upon it with bugfixes and Quality of Life features that fit
today's standarts, the series setting and theming.

-So what's in it then?

Here's a full feature list:

The game's original bugs and glitches have been fixed, most notable fixes are all pokeballs working
as intented, item fixes, no Arbitrary Code Execution, no battle glitches/bugs and many more issues
have been sorted.

You can obtain all 251 pokemon without the need to do trades with other people, version exclusives can now
be found in the wild and certain evolution methods have been altered. (More info below)

The time when the sun rises and sets has been tweaked to logical ranges so that players
can take advantage out of all three parts of the day in the game easier.

TMs are now infinite use just like in later games.

When picking up or receiving TMs as gifts the name of the move will also be shown.

The starter pokemon sprites that are being shown before picking one are now in color.

There's a Move Reminder NPC at Move Deleter's home to teach your pokemon forgotten leveling moves.

Catching pokemon yields EXP to pokemon that took part in the battle like in later games.

Berry and apricorn trees now drop between 1 to 5 berries/apricorns.

Kurt will now immediately make balls so you dont need to wait an entire day for them.

The Lucky Number Show now occurs daily instead of weekly.

The Trainer House battle no longer has a daily limit.

You can challenge all Gym Leaders to a rematch as many times as you want after unlocking MT. Silver.
Both Gym Leaders and the Elite Four now have stronger teams for rematches much like the remakes.

The trainer card now includes an extra page for Kanto badges and all 16 badges are now
shown in color.

You can now see the shiny variant of a pokemon in the pokedex by pressing SELECT.

You can now choose one of many unique colors for your Pokedex UI in its SELECT menu.

All 251 pokemon now have uniquely colored sprites in menus and the overworld.
Shiny variants and shiny egg included.

You are able to release EGGs via the PC.

An extra text speed option "Instant" is added

Both the Battle Tower and Buena's Password feature additional rewards.

Carrie, the girl that enables Mystery Gift at the Goldenrod Department Store will offer
to Mystery Gift with you once per day. The item range is exactly the same as the real
Mystery Gift along with the ever rare Mirage and Bluesky mail (decorations are excluded at the moment)

Smashing rocks now has a chance to give you certain items, including fossils. (More info below)

Easily change the Real Time Clock by pressing DOWN + B on the title screen.

Weather conditions in battle are now shown if active via an appropriate icon in the move selection window.

Daytime/Nightime status is also shown with an icon in the main battle window.

A pocket PC is given to you as a reward from the programmer in the Celadon Mansion after completing the Pokedex.

-You said i can capture all 251 pokemon, what about Celebi and the Kanto legendaries?

The Celebi event has been restored. It will occur normally once you beat the Elite Four like in the
Virtual Console release.

The Kanto legendaries have been placed onto the overworld like in later games, Mew included.

-What about fossil pokemon?

By smashing rocks there's a chance you'll get one of three (3) Kanto fossils. You can revive them the same way you did
in Gen 1 at the corresponding NPC which is in the Ruins of Alph Research Center.

-You said altered evolution methods, what about that?

Certain pokemon now evolve thanks to the item "Link Cord" which acts like an evolutionary stone much like in Pokemon Legends: Arceus.
More info on the new encounters and ways to evolve pokemon can be found in the "Encounters and Evolutions.txt" file.

-Can you Trade/Battle in this?

Yes but also no. Trading works 100% and fixes for bugs/mishaps that occur during Link Battles have been implemented, however Link Battles
should be between two (2) Patched Crystal games not one (1) Patched Crystal game and any Gen 2 vanilla game as there will
be desynchronization/corruption due to these changes.

-What about other kinds of compatibility?

PPC can be linked with both Stadium games just fine either on real hardware or emulated versions.
Save editors like PokeHex or PKSM still work, although certain pokemon will be marked as "illegal" considering the new encounter and evolution methods.
PPC saves are also compatible with certain features hosted on the bluemoonfalls.com website.

-When i check my items in PokeHex i get an invalid item warning and/or when i do the same in the Stadium games i carry a "Teru-Sama" item, whats that about?

You probably carry the new "Link Cord" item or the "Pocket PC" key item. Since these items dont exist in the original game, the instances above treat them
as the original "Teru-Sama" item which is nothing but a memory placeholder with no actual use so be wary of that if you tinker with your saves through external programs.

-What else you got in store for us?

Right now, i consider this romhack "complete" The initial goal of this project was to create "my dream version of Crystal" and it
reached that status but new vanilla-friendly features, tweaks or maintenance updates are not off the table.

-Why updates roll in such irregular rate?

Its not on purpose. Life gets in the way and im not a fully fledged programmer, all my work is based on very helpful guides and individuals
and whenever something cool comes up i take the safe approach and try it out internaly until im certain its fit for a release.

-Any way i can help?
